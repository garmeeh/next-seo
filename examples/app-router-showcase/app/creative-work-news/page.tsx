          <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. Sarah Chen and her team have successfully demonstrated quantum
            entanglement at room temperature, a feat previously thought
            impossible. The implications for quantum computing are enormous.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Details</h3>
          <p>
            The experiment utilized a novel approach combining laser cooling
            techniques with magnetic field manipulation. The team was able to
            maintain entanglement for over 100 milliseconds at 25Â°C.
          </p>

          <h3>Future Applications</h3>
          <p>
            This discovery opens doors for practical quantum computers that
            don't require extreme cooling, potentially making the technology
            accessible for everyday use within the next decade.
          </p>

          <h3>Industry Response</h3>
          <p>
            Major tech companies have already expressed interest in licensing
            the technology. "This changes everything," said a spokesperson from
            a leading quantum computing firm.
