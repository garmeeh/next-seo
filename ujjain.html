                <p>Shining like a gem in the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh,
                     the historic city of Ujjain is remarkably situated on the banks of holy Shipra River.
                    It is home to one of the twelve Jyotirlingas known as Mahakaleshwar,
                     also popularly referred to as Mahakal. Considered the reigning deity of time,
                    Lord Shiva is widely worshipped by devotees in the town.
                     This is the reason why Ujjain is thronged by followers throughout the year.
                    What is Ujjain famous for, beyond Mahakaleshwar Jyothirlinga?
                    There is not just one place but plenty of offerings from pilgrimage sites to heritage,
                     ancient crafts to food which a traveller can explore. 
                     Ujjain truly has endless travelling options if you want to travel and 
                     add a variety of things to your itinerary.

    <h2>DELIGHTFUL UJJAIN</h2>
    <p>
        Comb making
        The intricate designs and remedial advantages of a wooden comb were once used to be the driving factors behind the purchase.
         With the growing plastic market,
         it has become hard to find wooden combs that provide good sustenance to hair.
          But Ujjain has kept the art of wooden comb making alive! The kangi mohalla in town used to be the hub of comb makers however today, 
          there is only Thedalal Banjara left who is preserving this art by creating beautiful combs out of sheesham wood. 
          From duck shape to peacock, he tries to give each of his art piece a different design. According to him, 
          the wooden comb has its own importance. It improves blood circulation and stops hair fall.
           Not just this, one can pour in some oil and enjoy head massage too.
            If you are visiting Ujjain anytime soon, 
            do not forget to pay a visit to Thedalal Banjara's workshop and 
            do bring some pieces to gift and keep as a souvenir.

        -          The ancient art of Batik printing
        
        Located just a few kilometres from the magnificent Ujjain, the tiny village of Bherugarh is the focal point of Batik printing. It's an age-old art of wax-resist dyeing and printing on fabric which dates back to around 2000 years. The craft has been existing in Madhya Pradesh since the rule of Mughal times and is still as fresh and vibrant as the olden days. There are many traditional and modern techniques which the printers are using to give this art a much required fame and support. The beauty of the printing lies mainly in its unique technique which gives the fabric a subtle cracked effect after dying in beautiful hues. Artisans make beautiful bed sheets, sarees and dress materials which you can bring home and gift them to your loved ones!

    1] Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
    2] Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
    3]Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
    4]Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
    5]Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
    6]Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
    7]Stay home if you feel unwell.
    If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. 
    Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. 
    This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
    Masks
    Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from 
    the person wearing the mask to others. 
    Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, 
    and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.
