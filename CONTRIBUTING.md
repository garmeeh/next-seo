## Project Set Up

```
git clone git@github.com:garmeeh/next-seo.git

## Working with next-seo

All of the library code is located in the `src` directory.

The `e2e` directory contains a fully working Next.js app. This is used in the end to end tests. To run this app first you need to build next-seo. You can then run this app like a normal Next app by running `yarn build` (this builds the local next-seo) followed by `yarn e2e:dev`. You can also run it in a production build by running `yarn e2e:build` followed by `yarn e2e:build`.

To run Cypress run `yarn build` (this builds the local next-seo) followed by `yarn test:e2e`. Or to run all of the end to end tests headless run `yarn test:e2e:ci`

To run Jest tests run `yarn test`.
