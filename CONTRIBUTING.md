# Contributing Guide

Thanks for wanting to contribute to next-seo üòÅ

We are open to all and any contributions. If you are going to undertake quite a large feature or refactor, maybe open an issue first to start a discussion with the maintainers.

The fastest way to get a feature or bug fixed is to write a comprehensive request on Github. This project leverages AI coding tools heavily so if you can provide a lot context the maintainers will be able to leverage those tools.

If you would like to contribute directly then here are the steps:

1. Pull the repo and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:garmeeh/next-seo.git
pnpm install
```

2. Refer to (CLAUDE.md)[CLAUDE.md] and (ADDING_NEW_COMPONENTS.md)[ADDING_NEW_COMPONENTS.md] guides.
