    <h2>DELIGHTFUL KANHA</h2>
    <p>
        The largest national park in Madhya Pradesh with 941sq. 
        km expansion, Kanha National Park is considered to be one of the best administered and managed parks in India. It is one of the Navratanas of the 'Project Tiger'.
        
        Apart from the majestic royal Bengal tigers, Kanha inhabits barasingha as well, which was very close to extinction. It was then a successful conservation programme at Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh, that brought the animal back. Therefore the park is respected globally for saving the barasingha from near extinction. It is interesting to know that 'Bhoorsingh the Barasingha' is the official mascot for Kanha National Park. You will also get to spot bison roaming freely in their natural surroundings of Kanha.
        
        Hunting ground to leopards and wild dogs, Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh also shelters over 350 species of birds and 1000 + species of flora.
        
        Traversing Kanha National Park will give you a glimpse of the actual locations from the National Geographic's award-winning documentary film, 'Land of the Tigers', which was shot here.
        
        Spending some time with the Baiga tribe will be an all new experience. You can even learn to make tribal silver jewelry which is believed to be one of its kind. You can either shop the artefact as ornament or as a souvenir from Kanha.
        
        Knowing animal history at Kanha Museum, enjoying elephant bathing, trekking, wildlife viewing from machaan are some more activities you can enjoy during your visit to Kanha. 
        
        Basically a day or night jungle jeep safari in the park and bird watching will surely leave you with a lifetime thrilling experience.

                <td> <h2>Covid Precautions</h2>
    <pre>     
        1] Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
        2] Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
        3]Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
        4]Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
        5]Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
        6]Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        7]Stay home if you feel unwell.
        If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. 
        Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. 
        This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
        Masks
        Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from 
        the person wearing the mask to others. 
        Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, 
        and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.
        Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</pre>
